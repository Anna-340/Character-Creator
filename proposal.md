# Character-Creator
### This project will help artists to create characters with a random character generator. If the artist does not like a feature or characteristic they have the option of randomly generating a new one. 

###  This project will feature user imput in the form of "yes" or "no" when each feature of the character is randomized. If the user wants a different hair style or job or even statistics like stealth they can ask for a new option. For some of the generations like "no eyes" it will skip the eye color option, same with being bald.

### One topic that would need to be researched is keeping in mind the DRY concept as well as managing larger lengths of code and refreshing myself on accessing .txt files for prompts. 

### The ideal outcome of this code is to provide artists like me with a cool tool to get ideas flowing and could also be used by DND players for making NPC's or even their own character. I would go into many different aspects of a character like their skintone, height, body markings, traits, personalities, quirks etc. As for the minimum outcome for this project would be a simplified number of catagories for the character creator like only the head, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, legs, arms, body and what their job would be. 

### For milestones throughout the rest of the semester would be
###  - Week 12: Write diff catagories for character designer and plan out code
###  - Week 13: write code for the different head catagories
###  - Week 14: write code for the different body/arm/leg catagories
###  - Week 15: write code for the different job types
###  - Week 16: write code for the different  traits/personality/weapon
