# Character-Creator
### This project will help artists to create characters with a random character generator. If the artist does not like a feature or characteristic they have the option of randomly generating a different option. 

###  This project will feature user imput in the form of "yes" or "no" when each feature of the character is randomized. If the user wants a different hair style or job or even statistics like stealth they can ask for a new option. 

### One topic that would need to be researched is keeping in mind the DRY concept as well as managing larger lengths of code and refreshing myself on accessing .txt files for prompts.
