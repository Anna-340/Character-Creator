## Description
This project helps creatives like myself, create a character! The user can randomize between three different genders, age ranges from 10 to 100, height from 3 ft to 6’11, skin color, hair color/length (if the character is bald no hair color is displayed), eye color (if the character has eyes, if not then the eye color will be skipped), nose type, lip thickness/shape, jawline type, ear size/type, horn size/type or none (though it has a 25% chance of horns), skin texture, hand type (4-6 fingers), wing size/type (25% chance of getting wings), tail size/type (25% chance), characters magic class, job, personality and lastly their unique character quirk. While the user is selecting character features there is a progress bar at the bottom of the “Re-Roll Trait!” or “Accept Trait!” so the user can track their progress. Once the last trait has been accepted the program will display all the characters features, and also include a separate section for their stats and quirk! The stats include strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma, and stealth, and they can range from 1 to 20. Finally, at the very bottom of the window, if the user wants to create another character there is a button that says “Create Another Character!” If pressed the program will restart, and if the user wants to close the program they can simply hit the “X” at the top.
